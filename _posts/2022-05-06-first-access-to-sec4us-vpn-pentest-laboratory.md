At this point, you will be logged into our VPN/Challenges portal.

### Connecting to the VPN

After the first connection to the VPN portal, you will receive an OVPN file by email; this file should be used every time you connect to the VPN.

Download the `connection.ovpn` file and connect with your standard OpenVPN client. To connect to the VPN, use your email (as user) and the password registered on the Single Sign-On portal ([https://auth.sec4us.com.br](https://auth.sec4us.com.br)).

> **Attention:** Use your `email` as the user for the connection.
